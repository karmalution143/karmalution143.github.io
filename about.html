    <h1>Toronto</h1>
    <br>
    <p> Toronto, the capital city of Ontario, Canada, has a rich and diverse history that spans centuries. Originally inhabited by Indigenous peoples, including the Huron-Wendat, Seneca, and Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, the region was a vital trading hub for centuries. In the late 18th century, European settlers established the Town of York, which later became Toronto in 1834. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Toronto grew rapidly into a major economic and cultural center, fueled by immigration and industrialization. Today, Toronto stands as Canada's largest city, renowned for its vibrant multiculturalism, financial prowess, and global impact in arts, entertainment, and technology.
